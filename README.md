-------------------

This is a fork of ewewukek's Original Musket mod for Forge 1.20.1. This fork adds more guns and rebalancing mainly for servers. It changes the crafting recipes, damage values, and reload times.
This is early development and is not finished, If you have a really good suggestion then message me on discord (@warsnake901). Please don't suggest stupid shit or stuff already added by other mods.

**FAQ**

Q: How to attack the bayonet to the muskets. 
A: Put Bayonet in off-hand, with a musket in main hand then shift right click.

Q: Why Can I not see the recipe for the dopp.
A: The Dopp isn't craftable due to it being busted asf, aswell it was very rare irl
so you should have an admin spawn it for you for winning events etc.

Q: I found a bug, what do I do.
A: make an issue report with the logs file, aswell steps to reproduce said bug.
