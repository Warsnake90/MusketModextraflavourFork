**FABRIC IS NOT SUPPORTED ON THIS FORK, IF YOU NEED FABRIC THE ORIGINAL VERSION SUPPORTS IT!**

-------------------

This is a fork of ewewukek's Original Musket mod for Forge 1.20.1. This fork adds more guns and rebalancing. It changes the crafting recipes, damage values, and reload times.
This is early development and is not finished. If you wish to get a copy you have to build it yourself.
