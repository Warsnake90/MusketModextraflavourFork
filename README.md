### Forge / Neoforge

Requires [Cloth Config API](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config).

### Fabric

Requires [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api) and [Cloth Config API](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config).

### Mechanics

RMB loads and fires guns. Full sized ones can't be used from offhand.

All guns are unusable inside water and bullets lose power when flying through it.

Bullets can ignite TNT and destroy some blocks (only non-stained glass panes by default).

Headshots increase bullet damage by 30% (applies to most bipedal mobs).

Damage: 12\
Durability: 200\
Enchantments: Quick Charge

#### Paper cartridge (ammunition)
![](doc/cartridge_recipe.png?raw=true)

Dispensers can fire them dealing 10 damage.

### Monsters

Pillagers and skeletons (all kinds) can use guns. They also may spawn with one (20% for pillagers with a pistol, 5% for skeletons with a musket).

Monsters deal 50% damage with guns by default.

### Configuration

Settings can be accessed from NeoForge's mods menu or via [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) on Fabric.

Bullet spread follows normal distribution like in real life but it is awkward to configure. Here is a simple table that could help with that: [bulletStdDev](STDDEV.md "bulletStdDev")

Loot tables in namespace `musketmod` add items to matching vanilla loot tables. `pillager_weapon` and `skeleton_weapon` control what gun corresponding monster will get.

`item/enchantable/*` tags control what enchantments can be added to the guns.\
`block/*_by_bullets` tags control which blocks would be destroyed or dropped by bullets.\
`entity_type/headshotable` tag controls which mobs are considered for headshot detection.

#### 3D Modeling

Mod provides following model predicates:

- "loaded" - hammer is cocked
- "loading" - matches loading animation in 3rd person
- "aiming" - matches crossbow hold pose in 3rd person

Example: [musket.json](src/main/resources/assets/musketmod/models/item/musket.json#L255)

Mod's blockbench models can be found [here](blockbench).
